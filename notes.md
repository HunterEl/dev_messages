## /dev/messages

- Act like a linux FD, send a message over a transportation protocol (HTTP in this case)
- Dead simple API, send a message to someone, poll to receive messages, see history between someone, schedule messages to go out. That's it.
- Very easy way to send messages over an API.
- Easy to view history between you and someone else.
- Group Messages eventually.
- Needs to be ludicrously fast...
- multiple accounts per person (specify profile)
